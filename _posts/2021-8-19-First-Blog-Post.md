title: Thoughts on Data Science articles
---

I believe being a data scientist is about having a deep understanding of data analysis. This person will have the ability to solve various types of problems involved in the computer and mathematics field, individually and collectively. 
The knowledge area that a data scientist would need includes computer science, mathematics and statistics and the major duties involve connecting each of those components together to better interpret data.
The main similarity between data scientists and statisticians is they have the job of gathering information for purposes that benefit a particuluar interest and analyzing the meaning behind whatever is being studied. The difference comes in by how the collection of that information is completed. Moreso, the processes, size of data collected and, even the terminology tends to differ greatly.  

In relation to these two areas, I view myself as more of an aspiring statistician than a data scientist. Although the knowledge of programming software and machine learning is needed in both areas, I feel as though my current level of expertise would hinder me from getting position as a data scientist at the moment. I hope to gain more knowledge in every aspect necessary to become an accomplished statistician.
